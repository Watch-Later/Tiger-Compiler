To run these tests, you need to install cunit first.

Each folder ended with '_Test' is a test folder. Inside each test folder:
	1.'makefile'	---------	makefile.
	2.'*.out'	---------	executable file.
	3.'Test_*.*'	---------	main source file for test purpose.
	4.'*.o'		---------	other object files.

NOTE, file `test49.tig` in testcases folder is designed to have syntax error, so abstract syntax tree canot be generated normally.

Attentions:
	There is not wrong if you see no memory free either in some source
files or test files, becausethe first part of tiger compiler do not
implement GC. 

Each set of tests are stored inside one folder.
	1.To run tests:
		a.type 'export LD_LIBRARY_LIB=PATH', which PATH is your own
cuint library path.
		b.you may also need to change cunit lib path and headers
path in the makefile correspodingly.
		c.type every '*.out' inside each folder in you terminal.
	2.To compile tests, type 'make' in your terminal.
