Fatal:
	1.  two testcases not passed: merge.tig, queens.tig. The possible reason is WRONG address calculation
	of OUTER scope variables. When calculating outer scope variable addresses, currently we get the address
	by adding total local variable memory sizes(including a static link variable, formal variables and local
	variables) with the current base pointer (namely ebp) in current frame.If multi frames were involved, 
	the above step is repeated until the frame is matched with the one of the variable. 
Enhancements:
	1.  remove same det and src move instructions
	2.  redundent string definition
	3.  test broken due to tricks used in C unit tests(myLiveness and mySemantic, recursiveDecs, myCanonical)
